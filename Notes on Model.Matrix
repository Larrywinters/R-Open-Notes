# Simple notes on Model.Matrix
# A very importance usage of model.matrix is to matrixize/visualize the factor value into numeric value in R.
# For instance, if i have a sequence of factor value with 5 levels
a <- factor(sample(1:5,10, replace = T))
# And I want to convert those factor value into a matrix of 0 and 1, we can use mode.matrix to do so.
model.matrix(~0+a)
# each row indicate a factor. each column indicates a factor level (in this case 5 columns for 5 levels a1 to a5) 
# For example a factor of 3 is shown as 0,0,1,0,0 in a row. Notes that all the value in the matrix are numeric.
